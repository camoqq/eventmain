 1.created card layout using antdesign. I installed antdesign through
 the terminal and then hardcoded the json of the card

 2.created layout of the homepage. I used css styles to create the layout 
 by adding 5 columns of cards per row.

 3.I added the events menu on the left side of the page.

 4.created the context of the website. I generated the fake data with the 
 faker json and then implemented the data managment of the page with the
 useContext Hook. Even though i have not used any reducers at the moment,
 i need to call the reducer Function with the useRedecer Hook.
 
5.I tested the Events component to see if the text was being displayed
in the page.
